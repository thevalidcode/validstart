# Validstart: Universal Project Scaffolder ðŸš€

Validstart is a powerful and intuitive command-line interface (CLI) tool meticulously crafted to streamline the project setup process. It aims to eliminate repetitive boilerplate and accelerate your development workflow by providing a consistent way to scaffold projects across various languages and frameworks. Whether you're embarking on a new backend service, a sleek frontend application, a robust full-stack solution, a handy CLI utility, or a reusable library, Validstart is designed to get you started quickly and efficiently with your preferred technology stack.

## Installation

To get Validstart up and running on your machine, follow these simple steps:

### Global Installation (Recommended)

To use Validstart as a global command-line tool, install it via npm:

```bash
npm install -g validstart
```

### Local Development Setup

If you wish to contribute to Validstart or run it directly from its source code:

1.  **Clone the Repository**:

    ```bash
    git clone <repository-url>
    ```

    Replace `<repository-url>` with the actual URL of this repository.

2.  **Navigate to the Project Directory**:

    ```bash
    cd validstart
    ```

3.  **Install Dependencies**:

    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

4.  **Build the Project**:
    ```bash
    npm run build
    ```

## Usage

Validstart provides an interactive experience to guide you through project creation.

### Starting a New Project

To begin scaffolding a new project, simply run the `init` command:

```bash
validstart init
```

This will launch a series of interactive prompts where you can define your project's characteristics:

- **Project Name**: The name of your new directory and project.
- **Project Type**: Choose from `Frontend`, `Backend`, `Fullstack`, `CLI Tool`, or `Library/Package`.
- **Language**: Select your preferred programming language (e.g., JavaScript, TypeScript, Python, Go, Rust, Java, PHP, HTML/CSS).
- **Framework**: Pick a specific framework or library relevant to your chosen language and project type (e.g., React, Express, Django, Spring Boot, Next.js).
- **Additional Tools/Libraries**: Opt for extra utilities to be included in your setup (e.g., TailwindCSS, React Router, Dotenv).

Validstart will then set up the necessary directory structure, boilerplate code, and install initial dependencies automatically.

### Test Command

You can quickly check if Validstart is working correctly by running the `hello` command:

```bash
validstart hello
```

You should see a cheerful confirmation message in your terminal.
